Workshop reflection:
*********************
This week’s workshop covered uploading and writing to files in addition to extensive use of dynamic memory allocation. I found this workshop being challenging and I am happy I started working on it a head of time to have the opportunity for margin of error. We haven’t reviewed the material of files in class, so I had struggled to understand the material solely through course notes. In addition, I had some memory leak issues, that I eventually solved using the visual studio debugger. That struggle put a huge emphasis to remember to deallocate all memory and if a certain condition does not met, and to remember to set the function into a safe state. 

Milestone reflection:
*********************
Milestone 1 covered 2 different modules, one date and another one with a menu. The date module takes user input and validates it. Whereas the menu module presents a list of food items and allows the user to choose the food items. I found milestone being less challenging than the workshop as most of the material was covered in class. 
The milestone represented function overloading, and output through otream in addition to different ways to ignore inputs, clearing the buffer and throwing different error messages by using errCode.
